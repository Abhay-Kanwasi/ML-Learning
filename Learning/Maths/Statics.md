# Statics

Branch of mathematics that involves collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting data.

### Two types of statics:
<b>Descriptive Statics</b> : It's a branch of statics to analysis, summary, and presentation of findings related to a data set derived from a sample or entire population. Descriptive statistics comprises three main categories â€“ Frequency Distribution, Measures of Central Tendency, and Measures of Variability. 

<b>Inferential Statics</b>: Used for prediction for upcoming future using currently available data. Inferential statics is all about prediction about population.

<b>Terminology</b>

`Population` : Entire group of individuals or objects that we studying for analysis.

`Sample`: Subset of population, smaller group of individuals or objects that we select from the population to study.

<b>Example</b>
____

Population Example                                   | Sample Example                                  
-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------
All cricket fans that watch match(include OTT, TV).  | All cricket fans who are present in the stadium
All students of college(include passout students, online class students as well)| All students who visit lectures.                                    

* Note: Things to be careful about while creating sample
    - sample size
    - biased(random) sample
    - Representation

 
### Types of data

* Categorical or Qualitative Data (Example: Gender, Brands)
    - Nominal Data : No order in categories | ex: male, female
    - Ordinal Data : Order in categorical data | ex: bad, average, good

* Numerical or Quantitative Data (Example: age, height)
    - Discrete Data : Only take integer value. | ex: age, rank
    - Continuous Data : Such data which can take any value | ex: weight, height


### Measure of Central Tendency
___
Statistical measure that represents a typical central value for a dataset provide summary of data by identifying a single value that is most representative of the dataset as a whole.

Ex: We have a list of passengers in a bus with their age now we want to calculate centrality of this data. This measuring called central tendency.

For this measure we need some parameters like mean, median and mode.

- Mean(Average) : Sum of all values in the dataset divided by the number of values.

    <i> Formula : </i> `sum of all values` / `total number of values` 


    Ex: data = [3, 4, 1, 2, 5] Calculate the mean ?

    calculating_mean = 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 5 / 5 => 3 (mean = 3)


    Note: Mean is different for population mean and sample mean

    <i>Flaw in mean is called <b>outlier</b>, this means if one of the value is so large in data the mean can't be correct then. So in this kind of case don't use mean as a parameter use median</i>

<br /><br />
- Median : Middle value in the dataset when the data is arranged in order.

    - In case of odd number of data

        data = [3, 4, 1, 2, 5]

        median = 1,2, <b>3</b>, 4, 5

        median = 3

    - In case of even number of data

        data = [3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 6]

        median = 1, 2, <b> 3, 4, </b> 5, 6

        median = (3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5

        median = 3.5

<br />

- Mode : The value that appears most frequently in the dataset.

    data = [1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5]

    frequency of 1 : 3,  2 : 1, 3 : 1, 5 : 1

    mode of data is : 1 | because 1 is most frequent

    <i>Note : Mostly used in categorical data, discrete data</i>

<br />

- Weighted Mean: Sum of the products of each value and it's weight divided by the sum of the weights. It is used to calculate a mean when the values in the dataset have different importance or frequency.

    Example : 3 models for rent prediction 
    
    Model1 | Importance | Result
  |---------|-----------|----------|
    Model 1 |  0.2      |  10L  
    Model 2 |  0.3      |  15L
    Model 3 |  0.5      |  12L

Weighted mean = (0.2 * 10L + 0.3 * 15L + 0.5 * 12L) / 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.5


<br />

- Trimmed Mean : Calculated by removing a certain percentage of the smallest and largest values from the dataset and then taking the mean of the remaining values. The percentage of values removed is called the trimming values.
